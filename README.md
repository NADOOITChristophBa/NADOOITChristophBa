- 👋 Hi, I’m @NADOOITChristophBa
- 👀 I’m interested in making the world a better place, one line of code at a time. Using my skills to help others. Finding solutions to problems. Discovering new and old forgotten things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a better person. Starting with myself. Working on my mental health and my physical health. I am working on building a company that will help others.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a new Python framework for structuring software projects.
- 📫 You can reach me via email: christoph.backhaus@nadooit.de
